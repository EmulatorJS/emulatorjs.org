# CDN
The CDN has any version of the emulator. The cdn is [`https://cdn.emulatorjs.org/`](https://cdn.emulatorjs.org/). You can use this to get the stable, latest, nightly and any other main version by setting your `EJS_pathtodata` to `https://cdn.emulatorjs.org/<version>/data/`.

There are 3 different version name that you need to be aware of:
1. [**stable**](https://cdn.emulatorjs.org/stable/) - This will be the most stable version of the emulator both code and cores will be tested before release. It will be updated every time a new version is released on GitHub. This is the default version on the Demo.
2. [**latest**](https://cdn.emulatorjs.org/latest/) - This will contain the latest code but use the stable cores. This will be updated every time the *main* branch is updated. Using latest will occasionally be broken, it is only recommended to use stable in production.
3. [**nightly**](https://cdn.emulatorjs.org/nightly/) - This will contain the latest code and the latest cores. The cores will be updated every day, so this is consiterd alpha.
