If you are looking for an alternative to linuxserver's Docker project, we recommend using [Gaseous](https://github.com/gaseous-project/gaseous-server) which is a great alternative. You can also join the Gaseous Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/8NumXJmtnE).

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to give developers an easy way to embed an emulator onto their website.

## How it Works

EmulatorJS is a backend service that hosts its [selection of emulators](/docs/systems) that may be embedded into your website. This is not an all-in-one stand alone server.
