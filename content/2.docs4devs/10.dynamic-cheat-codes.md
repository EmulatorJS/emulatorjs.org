# Dynamic Cheats

EmulatorJS allows you to load cheat codes dynamically from JSON files.

## 1. Create a Cheats Folder
First, you need a directory on your web server to host your cheat files.
* **Example:** `/emulatorjs/cheats/`

## 2. Add Your JSON Files
Create a JSON file for each system. The filename **must** match the core name used in your configuration (e.g., `nes.json` for the NES core, `snes.json` for SNES).

### JSON Structure
The JSON file should use the game's title as the key, followed by an array of objects containing the description and the cheat code.

**Example: nes.json**
```json
{ 
 "Super Mario Bros.": [
    { "desc": "Super jump", "code": "TPZLTG" },
    { "desc": "Mega-jump", "code": "APZLGG" }
  ],
 "The Legend of Zelda": [
    { "desc": "Infinite Health", "code": "SZLZZZ" }
  ]
}
```

## 3. Update Your Configuration
In your main EmulatorJS configuration file, add the path to your cheats **folder** (do not link directly to the `.json` file).

window.EJS_cheatPath = "/emulatorjs/cheats/";

## How It Works
* **Matching:** EmulatorJS will attempt to match the name of the loaded game file to the keys in your JSON. For example, if your ROM file is named `super-mario.nes`, it will successfully match with the entry `"Super Mario Bros."` in your JSON.
* **Manual Fallback:** If a system or specific game is not found in your JSON files, you can still use the emulator's built-in menu to add cheats manually as usual or select the correct game from the list.
